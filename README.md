## GitHub for pedagogical purposes
author: Tiffany A. Timbers, Ph.D.

Practice leads to habits; this is one central reason why we have chosen to use
GitHub as a course delivery system for the Master of Data Science (MDS) program.
Git and GitHub are currently one of the most widely used and popular platforms
for version control, and version control is a critical part of Data Science
workflows. By the end of the program, MDS students will have had the opportunity
to practice using Git and GitHub at least 300 times. In addition to this student
benefit, using Github as a course delivery system allows for fully electronic
reading and grading of student work, simplifying the instructorâ€™s workflow.
This presentation will be a tour through the Github course delivery system used
in the MDS program and it will also introduce other Git and Github tools that
are useful for teaching.
